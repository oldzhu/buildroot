Subject: [PATCH] meson: do not automatically build documentation if
 sphinx-build-3 is found

Commit aba567338b25 ("Documentation: Move all dependencies into
features") did an incomplete migration of the documentation boolean
option into a documentation feature.

If sphinx-build-3 binary is found on the host system, the documentation
is built, regardless of the value of the feature option.

This makes sure that sphinx-build-3 presence is only checked if the
documentation feature is not disabled (which is the default, as it's
"auto" by default).

This is essential for reproducibility for build systems where
sphinx-build-3 may or may not be present when libcamera is built, and
also to declutter the generated package if documentation isn't desired.
