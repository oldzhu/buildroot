if BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BARE_METAL_BUILDROOT

config BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BARE_METAL_BUILDROOT_ARCH
	string "list of architecture tuples"
	help
	  This option allows to define the list of architecture
	  tuples for which bare-metal toolchains will be created.
	  One toolchain will be built for each of the architecture
	  tuples specified in this option.

	  For example, to build both a Microblaze and a RISC-V bare
	  metal toolchain, use the following definition:
	  "microblazeel-buildroot-elf riscv32-buildroot-elf"

config BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BARE_METAL_BUILDROOT_MULTILIB
	bool "Enable multilib"
	help
	  Sometimes the default GCC and newlib libraries for a given
	  architecture are not the desired ABI. Since ABI
	  definitions are different for each architecture, this
	  option will enable multilib configuration, so that all
	  available ABI libraries are built which will guarantee
	  that the desired version will be available for user
	  applications.

	  When enabled, this option will apply to all architecture
	  tuples in the list.
